## Suggestions
- Remember to break down large tasks into small manageable pieces with deadlines
- DO NOT use company equipment for personal use, even if its okay!
- Ask for help, but think it through before and try to solve it on your own
- Learn what everyone else does (job role, project they are working on)
- DO NOT stress, you are not expected to contribute to the team for another

## Remember
- Come in do your time, 8 hours, and leave
	- Do not feel like you have to do 13 hours, you have to show your time is important
	- If there needs to be training, they will train you for the 8 hours.
- Watch out for impostor syndrome when you cannot complete your first or second task
	- To do: try it to complete it on your own first, and then ask. Even if you hesitant, just ask to make sure your doing it right.
		- The person helping you, will be more than happy to help you or guide you in the right direction.
- Remember there will be a lot of meetings
- Remember you are expendable (of little significance when compared to the overall purpose, and therefore able to be abandoned)
	- Always have a second job in your back pocket
		- you do not have to take the interviews, offers; but you should have them lined up, because it takes weeks to get them.
