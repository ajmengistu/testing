𝟭. It’s NOT all about you.

This is a big mistake that everyday people are unaware of. Talking about oneself although can make one feel important, makes another feel worthless and just like a brick wall as they feel silenced and never get an input. A strategy I like to use is you always ask questions to your friend/s until they ask you. That's when it's your time to shine. Just remembeer not to "interview" your compadres however at the same time not to Ted talk into the night. It's all about reading the room if you fall into the trap.

(Talking about stories, never interrupt someone else’s story/anecdote/toast until the story is complete. It’s downright ignorant and tells the person they’re not worth listening to)

2. Keep negative/depressing talk to a minimum. (Complaining, Opening Up etc.)


Although this can be really innocent as friendships are built on these vulnerabilities, constantly talking anout your hardships for sympathy can actually ruin the relationship if there is too much of it. As friends feel the pain when you complain or vent. However they WILL ALSO ASSOCIATE those feelings to YOU. Hence might drive them away as they don't want to havee those emotions on a regulat basis. Just know the time and place and keep it at a minimum. (This can also be said about bragging/boasting of your “good” achievements too much on the other end)

3. This is only over text/call, but NEVER tell a friend you’re texting or calling them because you’re “bored”.

It coincides with Rules #1 and #2. This can depend on the friendship as well, it's perfectly acceptable sometimes but not others. As it can be fun to call when you're bored if the two of you talk daily. However, if it's a dry few days/weeks with no contact and you hit up a friend to talk and it goes like.

You: Hey there

Friend: Hey, What's up?

You: Nothing much just bored.

You're basically telling your friend that they're a toy for when you literally have NOTHING LEFT IN THE WORLD to do and you're a last resource. Intead have a topic to talk about or just say:

"Just wanted to check to see how you're going :)"

Already a lot more positive.

EDIT 2: Something to clarify with Point 2, I may have generalised. Think of friendship as a muscle and the weights used to grow the muscle as vulnerability/opening up. Like a muscle, the friendship grows with the deep moments and relatable understanding times. However “undertrain” and your friendship is only surface level and no growth happens. But “overtrain” and the muscle gets tired strained and eventually is injured, this is the same with friendship rather the friendship gets harmed. It’s about a healthy balance of positive fun and goofy times to the raw connections in sync. And it’s not that people are bad for opening up/venting/complaining, it’s just too much emotional weight to carry.
