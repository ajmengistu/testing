## 401k with Employer
- Potential Issues:
	- When you leave your old job, the 401k that you had with your previous employer will be lost if you do not ROLL it it over to another account.
- 


## 401k Tips
- Rebalance portfolio with correct percentage (90 in Index Funds; 10 in bonds)
	- If Some index outperform others. Try to rebalance portfolio with new Cash, rather than taking some from the winner index and distributing to losers. 
- Always invest up to the amount the employer matches to take advantage of free money
	- Ex: if the employer matches up to 4%, then put in that much into your 401k
- Make sure to report the rollover on your __Tax Return__
	- Fidelity or 401k provider will send over Form 1099 to show money was taken out of your 401k
	- Also, Fidelity will send over Form 5498 showing you've contributed money to IRA.
	- In the end, the 1099 and 5498 Forms will cancel each other, hence the Roll Over, and you will not owe any taxes
	- Make sure you complete 1099 and 5498 Forms, the year you did the Roll Over  

- Tips from CNBC 
	- Hold 80 to 90% in stocks or equity until age 50 
	- Always take a longer-term view and not react to market swings
	- Examine Allocations 
		- at minimum once a year
		- quarterly when near retirement
		- Re-examine when life changes take place
