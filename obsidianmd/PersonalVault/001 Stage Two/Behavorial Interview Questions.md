# Behavioral Questions
MUST KNOW: Interview tend to stress most people out
(**be specific**) use a lot of I's  (what I did was...) and connect it back to the company.

## Keep in mind for GM 2-hr HM interview
- enthusiastic about role, (HM do not want to waste time and resources on candidates that have one foot out the door), do research about the company, recent news about the company on the website, show that you love software development and GM mission to show you want to stick around, know your career goal (5 to 10 years)

## General motors top behavioral questions 

### Team related

- "Describe a time when you had to convince someone using data"  
- Tell me about a time you had to convince a co-worker with data?, Tell me a time you convinced someone to see things your way?
	- Well, its important to use data rather than emotions.
		- With that being said, the time...
	- I had to convince my team member that rep 
	- I learned that anytime I try and persuade someone with an opposing viewpoint, I've found that backing up your position with well thought out facts and research is the most effective approach in doing so.

- Tell me about a time where you were right about something but others disagree with you and how did you handle it? project., Describe a time you had to make a decision in a group project that the other group members did not like, but you had a genuine reason to make the decision, When was a time when you had a different opinion from another team member and how did you resolve this conflict?
	- In my previous internship I was working with a group to conduct an experiment and prepare a presentation of our results. As group we came up with an idea and a plan to implement our idea. 
	- A problem arose, where two of the team members wanted to hold daily meetings to discuss progress of project. I disagreed with this approach because we can easily communicate through messaging and google docs to document our progress.
	- Instead of starting an argument about the meetings, I gathered everyone together in the laboratory to communicate to them my  reasoning. 
		- I argued that as long as everyone knew their tasks, we did not need to divert time for meetings that did not move the project forward. Moreover, these meetings would use up valuable time that we could to complete the project. 
		- I then, listened without judgment to their side of the argument. I remained patient and avoided interruption even though I disagreed with their reasoning.
	- Eventually, I decided to come to a general agreement and meet them halfway. The decision was to hold a daily meeting that would last no more than ten minutes where everyone provide a short update on their progress of their tasks.
	- In the end, we were able to complete the project on time and present our work.
	
- What would you do when a teammate isn't pulling their weight?, A time when you worked with a difficult person.  Are you a team player in what way?, Tell me about a time where teamwork was essential?,
	- One of the team members was behind and said he probably could not finish his part of implementing the Express API of the project in time, which prevent me from making progress.
	- I sat down with him in private away from everyone else to understand why he was unable to finish his section of the project in time. I showed empathy and listened to his problem.
	- He explained to me that he had been having computer issue, his computer was giving trouble because of the `npm` project dependencies was not working correctly and was unable to complete his the API implementation.
	- At the end, we were all able to complete our work in time, and the project was completed successfully.
	- I learned taking the time to communicate the issue and showing empathy and listening to understand his situation, and figuring out a solution was critical for the project completion. 

### Self situations, projects related
- What has motivated you to become a developer?
	- Internship experience, cemented my interest in software engineering
	- then, how you broke that goal down into small manageable pieces with deadlines to avoid procrastination  
	- connect how you will bring value to the company.
	- What motivates you?
		-  I thrive on completing tasks and projects ahead of schedule, and I am naturally a curious person,I love learning new things and collaborating with a team to work toward a common goal. I have learned in school and my internships that there is more than one correct way to complete most tasks, and I am highly motivated to brainstorm ideas before a project begins, to find the most efficient path to completion that will offer the best outcome for the business. As an example, in my last internship I worked with my 2 mentors to implement a d3js visualization model. Because we were able to brainstorm different possible solutions in advance, I was able to complete and present my project within a short deadline
		
- When have you completed a difficult task or project?, When have you learned a new skill or qualification?,  When was a time you learned something new and what did you learn from it?,  When was a time you worked really hard on a project and what was the result? A project you worked on and your proud of? and Why? 
	 , Changes you would make to it?
	- A project that I really worked hard on was developing a book tracker app with a microservices architecture.
	- This was a difficult task because at that time I was only familiar with developing  full-stack monolithic applications. Because of this, I had to learn new concepts about microservices and the technology tools needed to implement one.
	- I begin by using the SDLC process to plan, define, design, build, test, and deploy within a two week deadline.
	- To achieve this goal:
		- Then, I planned & design a high level diagram of how each component of the application fit together. For example, having  a book and user service with their own databases. 
		- Then, integrated the client side using Angular.
	- In the end, I was able to successfully complete this difficult project and deploy an Docker image of a  working microservices application to Docker Hub.
	- I learned that persisting through challenges by breaking down problems into small tasks and prioritizing task based on logical order allowed me to stay on track to achieve my goal. 

- Tell me about a time you were in a difficult situation. How you faced adversity and how you dealt with it?  A challenge faced?,  Describe a challenge you faced and how you overcame it, Describe a project you had difficulty doing? How did you solve it?
	- When I was learning to program and to code for the first time in undergrad, the challenge i faced, or the difficult situation i faced was, an Python error that occurred in a major project that I couldn't resolve for couple of days. The project was due within a week and consisted of fetching a remote data via an API and creating a graph.
	-  The situation was very challenging and frustrating and I almost wanted to give up a career in software engineering.
		- I worked backwards from the end product, and created a to-do list.  I prioritized tasks based on the logical order of completing the pieces. "What should I do first, second ...". 
		- Fetch the data from the API, then parse the data, cleanup and store only the data i needed. 
		- Incrementally coded and tested each task.
		- As a result, breaking down the problem allowed me to pin point the bug that was actually causing the problem, which as a regex parsing error.
	- At then end, note only was I able to complete the project on time, I was able to receive an excellent grade on the assignment.
	-  I learned that when I face a programming challenge, to remain calm and seek help to understand challenging concept. Then, step back and understand the bigger picture before breaking the problem down into small manageable pieces through incremental coding and testing.

- Give an example of a goal you reached and tell how you achieved it. 
	- My objectives for my internship were both completed and I also was able to develop proficiency in JavaScript and CSS. 
		- 1. At the start of my internship, I sketched a model of the final product to understand the big picture.
		- 2. I worked backwards from the end product, and created a to-do list of what I need to do to achieve that outcome. I prioritized tasks based on the logical order of completing the pieces. "What should I do first, second ...". For example, understanding d3js code before implementing the model.
		- 3. Then, I created a timeline for completing each task. Having a deadline helped me become more focused for each task.
				- For example, for the first week it was important to become familiar with the basics of CSS and JavaScript by using online resources.
				- Read and understand the research articles about the algorithm.
				- Then, I research example D3js models to get an idea the final product
		- 3. In addition, I made sure, I met with my mentor every day to discuss my progress to stay on track and make appropriate adjustments to the plan.
	- In the end, I was able to become proficient in JavaScript and CSS and complete my project in time and present my results.
	- I learned breaking large tasks down into smaller manageable pieces allowed me to avoid stress and procrastination.
	
- Can you tell me about a mistake you made at work and how you handled it?, Tell me about a time you failed and the lesson you learned from it, Tell me about a time in which you could have done things differently.
	 - I made the mistake..., I failed to..., What I could have done differently is... ask for help.
	 - At my previous internship, I had to implement a feature in a project and this was a visualization model on web page was not correctly rendering on the browser and moreover I had to present the project within a couple of days.
	 - The mistake i made was that rather than asking my mentor for assistance out of fear of looking incompetent, I spent a whole day and half trying to debug the problem by-myself without any progress. Then, I was worried that I would not be able to complete the presentation in time.
		 - However, in my next meeting I was able to bring up the problem.
		 - I admitted my mistake to my mentor and took full responsibility and that I should have sought help earlier. 
		 - Luckily, I managed to catch the mistake before the presentation was due to take place and I asked my mentor for help to complete it in time. 
	- Now, I make sure to ask early enough to allow people plenty of time to tackle the task.
	- I know the role emphasizes teamwork and the need to be in constant communication with one another, and I believe my ability to ask and answer questions of my peers makes me well suited to your company culture.
	 
- If you had a lot of things to do and not enough time to do them, what would you do?
	- When I was taking a course on research writing, I had a semester assignment to write a research proposal on a scientific topic and had to be completed within a month.
	- I was used to working under tight deadlines in undergrad, so I set up a week-by-week high level plan for what I needed to complete for the month taking into account other major assignments and exams for other courses. 
		- First week, find a research topic "exercise and meditation as alternative forms of therapy for anxiety and depression" 
		- Second week, do research on the topic and plan the skeleton of the paper
		- Third week, write rough draft and have someone revise it at the writing center
		- Forth week, write the final draft. 
		- 	For example, when the first week of the of research proposal, I need to do a little research on each of the topics and I made sure I chose one by the end of the week.
	- Also, I understand that priorities can shift unexpectedly. Knowing this, I try to limit the number of daily tasks and try to save time in the event that I needed to make adjustments for any changes to my daily workload.
		- For example, programming assignment might take me longer than expected, so I would allocate some time to complete research paper over the weekend.
	- This plan allowed me to efficiently complete the assignment on time, but also with a excellent grade.
	- I learned that creating a clear plan, and doing the most urgent and important tasks first, while also adjusting the plan when the unexpected events happen, is the best way to complete projects and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

- Why do you want to work at General Motors?  
	- For example, When I was working on my book tracker microservices app I was dedicated. I was able focus without distractions and finish what I had started.
	-  I have the desire and readiness to acquire new knowledge because, for instance when I was developing the News Feed Django App, I was excited to learn a new framework.
	- I believe in GM's mission to create sustainable solutions that improve the communities in which we live and work. In addition to that, I would love the opportunity to use cutting-edge technology and industry best practices to build and support GM's systems and applications.
	- All in all, I feel my skills are particularly well-suited to this position and I believe I have the type of experience & skill set to succeed in this role as a Software Developer at General Motors.

	- Also, if the opportunity presents itself for me to progress within the organization that would be amazing.
	- And since I am really passionate about the work I do as a developer I would love the opportunity to mentor other employees later down the line.
	- All in all, I plan to stay with the company long-term if I am given the opportunity to work at General Motors. 

Tell me a little about yourself. 
* Hello my name is AJ, I graduated from the University of Maryland, CP in December 2019.
*  I have a strong work ethic, ability and willingness to learn.
* I have taught myself popular Java, Python, and JavaScript frameworks to build full stack monolithic & microservice RESTful web apps. I have deployed them to popular web hosting platforms such as AWS and Heroku. I have integrated third party APIs such as Google Books, Wikipedia, & The Movie DB. And familiar with DevOps tools Jenkins and Travis to create a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, & deploying.
* I also love giving back to the community. I write articles online that show how to integrate the latest technologies into projects. Furthermore, I have contributed to Open Source projects on GitHub.
* I am never done learning and always seek to improve myself. I believe my qualifications and experience gives me the necessary skills and abilities to make a meaningful contribution to General Motors. 

#### strengths/weakness
What are some of your strengths? 
	- For example, I when I learned that Vue.js was an alternative JS framework to React and Angular, I went online and read through the documentation and small project, and talks on YouTube. Then, I came up with a simple project to apply what I learned.
	- At the end I learned that Vuejs is a lot more simpler than Vuejs and fairly easy to pick up.
2. I am always seeking ways to improve and develop my skills to better perform at work.
	- How you learned microservices. I have strong work ethic so, to complete what I started.
3. I enjoy working collaboratively.
	- I work well both independently and as a team. At the same time, I also enjoy supporting and helping develop my teammates.
	- For example, I working with my mentor who was a graduate student and a Professor to implement a working project within a tight deadline.
	- I think the most valuable skill I have is time-management. I am diligent in using a calendar to plan long-term tasks and a todo-list to complete day to day tasks. In addition, I use time-blocking productivity method along with pomodoro technique to set blocks of time to complete task and take breaks. Planing helps me stay organized and manage my time wisely. 

What are some of your weaknesses? 
1.  Sometimes my weakness is prioritization. 
	- When I am already working on a project and I have a new project idea to implement.
	-  I stop working on the project that I was working to start this new project. Sometimes, I have to switch back and forth between project and this really hinders my progress and my ability to deliver my best work. 
	-  For example, microservice app broken down frontend, backend, server, db. Prioritize each task, backend, server, & db first before frontend, deploying, set up ci/cd pipeline
2. My other weakness is my writing skills. Sometimes my sentences are too wordy and include unnecessary words, this might negatively impact business. And so to improve my writing skills, I often publish blog posts online about new technologies that I learn in my spare time. And also write about some of the technologies that I integrate into my projects. This has helped better communicate my knowledge in a more concise, succinct way to others.

### Projects
Our culture is focused on building inclusive teams, where differences and unique perspectives are embraced so you can contribute to your fullest potential as you pursue your career. 

“I remained calm and didn’t react in anger or hostility to my coworker as I wanted to keep good working relations. I made my manager aware of the situation and their behaviour (even if you didn’t) and the situation cooled off over the next few weeks.”

```
Situational judgment questions. You’ll be asked what actions you would take when confronted with a hypothetical situation.
Scenario-based simulations. You’ll be asked to simulate your actions in a hypothetical scenario. The key difference between this type of question and a situational judgment question is that you’ll act out your response, rather than explain it.
Past behavior questions. You’ll be asked to relate past experiences and previous challenges you’ve faced.
