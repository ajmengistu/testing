I always tell the people that report to me that the 30 minutes I have setup for 1:1s with them are their time. Whatever you want to talk about in them is fine with me.

Want to talk about your kid's baseball team? Great!

Want to talk about how you're training for a half marathon? Cool!

Want to talk about how a guy on another team is making sexist remarks and belittling you because you're a woman? Not great or cool, but this is the appropriate time to bring it up.

Want to talk about your current project status? Super!

Want to talk about how you don't get along with someone else on the team? Yes, let's talk about that and how we can fix it.

Want to talk about your career and goals for the next 3 years? Awesome!

At the end of the day, my job as a manager is to make work as happy, comfortable, and enjoyable as possible. Because, if you are happy, comfortable, and you enjoy coming to work, you are much more apt to learn, to stick around, to work hard, and to help meet the team goals.

- you do not owe a company anything and the company don't owe you either
- Both agree on a wage for a job, and so you honor that much to the best of your abilities.
- you can be loyal to the people, stay in touch, help them make connections when they need it, handoff your work well
- Jumping ship every 2-3 years has always netted me a 20-40% pay bump, whereas internal promotions might get 7-10%.

- What if the reviewer is thinking "who hired this idiot"
- Don't take code personally. Ever. 
- It’s rarely an assessment of you as an individual and more often an assessment of the actual work and how well it meets it’s intended purpose
- Just remember that it's never your code. It belongs to the company and it's end goal is to reliably deliver value to the customer.
- If you wrote stupid code, you wrote stupid code. It doesn't mean you are stupid. It just means you wrote stupid code. Happens to the best of us. 
- The most important thing is to learn from your mistakes and do not repeat that mistake.
- There are plenty of senior devs writing terrible code because they are too stubborn and proud to learn.
- Do you best when writing the code and then let go of it. Code review exists so that your team can improve the overall quality of the code base. It's purpose is not to judge your programming skill. You can learn from your code reviews, but that is not their main focus. Their purpose is to ensure the company's codebase is the best it can be within the constraints of scope, timeline, and budget. 
- This should be an "us against the problem" situation, as in engineer + team + manager should all be incentivized to make CRs better for everyone. It is in everyone's best interest to deliver high quality code, and the team is one unit working towards the same goal. Is there any reason you feel singled out, or that people are entering a "you vs them" situation, instead of displaying an "us vs the problem" mindset?
