# Introduction
Patrick Henry's "Give me liberty or give me death" has become such a part of American culture, but students may not know where the phrase came from.

Tecumseh's equally persuasive "Sell a country? Why not sell the air?" 

Module 5: extends the study of Patrick Henry's famous speech to demonstrate the ways ==Native Americans also resisted oppression through rhetoric==. This will be done by examining and analyzing two speeches by Chief Tecumseh of the Shawnee alongside Henry's speech, so that students appreciate and develop a new respect for the Native Americans' politically effective and poetic use of language. 

Analyze both speeches and their methods for convincing his fellow whites and Native Americans to take a military stance against their common enemies. Material: documentary films, PowerPoint slides, and lectures to understand the period.

Rhetoric (use of written, spoken, visual language), pan-indianism (movement of aboriginal resistance to domination and assimilation via political, cultural, religious solidarity)

Patrick Henry 
- 1736 to 1799
- called for war of national liberation from British Empire
- Lived to see his American Dream con to full fruition.

Tecumseh

- articulated a spiritual message of early pan-Native American unity, revival and resistance against white interlopers (a person who becomes involved in a a place or situation where they are not wanted or are considered not to belong; intruder; invader)
- life cut tragically short when he was killed during the war of 1812, born in modern day Ohio
- Was a Shawnee chief, orator, military leader, and advocate of inter-tribal Indian alliance against white western expansion into native lands in the Ohio River valley.
- In the War of 1812, he joined British forces for the capture of Detroit and invasion of Ohio against the US troops
- 

Both
- staunch believers in the right of self-determination ( the process by which a country determines its own statehood and forms its own allegiances and government.)
- represented two opposing poles of interests and opinions, and still they were both equally visionary nation builders.

## B

Tecumseh refused to sign the treaty, He believed the land belong to all the Indian people and that it is shared by all Indians and could not be negotiated away. Tecumseh used several persuasive tools to persuade those who were selling or buying land and come together against the Americans that are attempting to force them out of their ancestral homes.
