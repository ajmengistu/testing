Lessons learned during my 7 months Working from Home as Software Test Engineer at General Motors.
Including social etiquette, professional etiquette

- After being Hired, You've got to chill. You can do whatever you want as long as you get the work done.
- Get the job / task done as soon or as early as possible to enjoy the rest of the day and leave early
- Or do the work as early as possible.
- Always come in to meeting late not early to avoid small talk.
- When you have a questions, just ask it as soon as possible. Learned from Michael Han.
- Always as clarifying questions when someone explains a problem/issue
- Use the term:
	- Bandwidth - I don't have much bandwidth to work on the task 
	- issue - problem
	- blockers - I have a blocker - Need to clarify - several things
	- Team
## Projects
### Single User Interface
- Say someone rather saying somebody 
- My assumption was that...
	- My guess is... 
	- I'm guessing because of this and this....
- Say the team and I or Keith and I or Keith and myself
- Use the word Team or QA or Dev Team to refer to a group of people
- Use the persons name rather than saying he or she or they
- When asking questions in a group, try to direct the question to someone specifically to get better answer
- Always thank someone after they answer your questions
### GWM Preval
- When someone asks you to tell them about yourself answer by:
	- My name AJ and I'm from Maryland and  I'm a new hire. Previously before taking on this position, I worked as Software Test Engineer, where I've done a mix of manual and automation testing. Now, I'm more interested software development and my excited to be part of this team.
- After someone introduces themselves to you, 'It's nice to meet you Miranda!'
- Always wait until your called to speak. Remember the meeting with 20 people and you spoke up to Sri to present your bug
	- Just keep quit until asked. If asked and your not sure, say I'm actually not sure, I may have to get back to you on that, but this is what I was thinking. But again, I'll have to get back to you on that.
