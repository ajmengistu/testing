## Every Morning (set a timer with 30 to 1hr)

As soon as you wake up:
- Review Home; some page where we can see both short- and long-term goals for Career and Personal (10 minutes)
- Home page or file should contain links to: 
	- goals (career and personal)
	- table of contents
- Process Notes that we've already took and move them into the next stage of the process
	- possible approaches:
		- do one from each stage for 10 minutes with speed
		- or do the second stage first until complete and save it for the next and go on to complete the next item in that bucket until all are completed
- Set up time, to watch YouTube videos and take notes at the same time. Do this with Articles that were captured on Notion as well.

## Reminders
- Always search online forums, mainly Reddit, sub-Reddit on doing research on a topic
	- For example, improving communication skills: google, search Reddit, View main subreddit indexes (for example: https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialEngineering/wiki/index)

	- !Important! When capturing notes, make sure to capture both sides of topic,issue, or idea

## To Do
- Use NOTION captured notes to transfer here: =>
	- do them early in the morning 30min - 45 minutes
		- reading articles or expanding on notes
		- use time blocking
