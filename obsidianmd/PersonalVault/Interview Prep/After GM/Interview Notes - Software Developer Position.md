- Phone Interview with Recruiter
	- This is a Entry Level Developer Position correct?
	- Will there be an opportunity to showcase my technical abilities, a coding challenge or speaking with a developer.
		- OR Will it just be an interview with Hiring Manager

- Paired Programming:
	- I personally have experience, not only in undergrad on group projects, but also in my current role,working to write code with my teammate and team leader one-on-one
		- Example (JSP, SQL, PostgreSQL) - Database class
	- I have also directly worked with developers to help them reproduce and fix bugs.
	- Process we have taken:
		- communicating my approach by considering pros and cons to certain decisions, but also once a decision is made make trade-offs by considering implications. 
		- When I'm struggling, asking question to clarify an issue. Most importantly communicating my train of though.
		- Before write code, it's also important to design a draft for a solution in order to better understand the problem, to anticipate coding structures.
	- I believe Pair Programming has amazing benefits. For example, it promotes communication and  knowledge sharing, which ultimately translates into higher quality software delivered to business, reduction in knowledge silos and better communication
	- The counter-argument to pair programming is that is it too slow, but I believe, I read somewhere, it's only 15% slower than having two developers for example working separately. On average, there is a fewer bugs when programming in pairs compared to separate.
	- Having fewer bugs during the early stage of development life cycle reduces the costs compared the later they are detected.
	- I believe my prior experience and background working in pair programming will help me become a productive member of the dev team.
