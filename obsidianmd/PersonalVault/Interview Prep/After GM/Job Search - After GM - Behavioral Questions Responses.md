## About You Questions
- Tell me about yourself? (Elevator pitch)
	- My name is A.J. and I'm currently working as a Software Test Engineer at General Motors under the Customer Care and After-sales and Warranty organization.
	- I am really passionate about Software Development. I particularly enjoy using technology and different tools to build full-stack web applications.
	- Through my current role and side projects, I have been able to hone my programming skills by developing apps that use modern frameworks such as Angular, Reactjs and Spring and I'm familiar with a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deploying apps to major web hosting platforms via GitHub, Azure DevOps, PCF (Pivotal Cloud Foundry), AWS (elastic beanstalk), and Jenkins.
	- I have worked on highly visible projects on large teams that use Agile development methodologies under my current position.
		- 3 week sprints = > Writing TCs and Automation Scripts => Test Execution 
	- In the past 10 months, I've helped deploy 2 projects and have been individually been recognized by my team lead and PM and my team has been recognized at the 1st quarter organization meeting for consistently delivering before deadlines despite major obstacles.
	- So, I believe this role is a great opportunity to apply my developer skills to build and support the company's systems and applications to help achieve the company's visions and business goals. 
		- Where are you currently?
			- I'm working remotely out of Maryland. I began working for GM during the pandemic. I had permission from my manager to work for the time being.

- Can you tell me a bit about your current role?
	- Currently, I'm working as Software Test Engineer under the CCA&W organization at GM. 
		- It encompasses all the parts and components that occur as soon as after a customer has been handed over their keys to their GM vehicle at a dealership.
	- Mainly providing automation testing for applications by writing and executing test cases using GM's testing framework, which is loosely based on Selenium Automation framework. This involved communicating across functionally with Dev and Business to get clarifications on business requirements. I call out defects and participate in daily defect-triage.
		- 3 week Sprints, first week 1/2 
	- I believe my experience spent automating front-end and backend testing and interacting with JavaScript, TypeScript, Java code will help me be a productive developer.
		- For example, as developer it's important to write unit tests with good coverage and spot bugs before they leak to QA team.

- Why are you leaving or want to leave your current position?
	- I have learned a lot in my current role, but Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity that provides more challenges as I continue developing my software development skills and abilities. I believe the experience and skills I've acquired so far such as writing code to automate testing, debugging, detecting bugs and along with my interest, passion willingness to learn new technologies have contributed to be a productive developer. So, I would love to work new/different projects as a developer, which is where my interest and passion lays at moment.
	- __And having a background working on projects that deal with dealership transactions and databases vehicle warranties at an automobile company such as GM will very interesting to work on the insurance side of vehicles at Allstate/State Farm.__

	- Real Reason?
		- I'm currently in the NCH program and the policy is to stay in the current role for 2 years before, applying to a different role. That felt it bit too long just to move onto a dev role. Since, there is a bit of downtime right now on my team, I figured right now was the prefect time to search for new opportunities.
		- I was not aware or it didn't occur to me to ask the question, as new college Hire, I was excited to take opportunity that I got. 

## Projects Currently Working on at GM

- singular user interface project
	- purpose:
		- Updating a legacy system that has redundant back-end features, hard to scale, and most importantly a system with a cost and time consuming process.
			- Essentially, they had mainframe system that service engineers used to insert, search, and release vehicle parts containing millions of records.
			- And for example, engineers would have to navigate multiple screen to complete several tasks. On-boarding new users was challenging because of the steep Learning curve.
		- The solution was to design a single UI for engineers to add, search, and release parts. Improving the time and cost of releasing parts and performing other tasks. For example, exporting aggregated data to spreadsheets for the business team, was something you cannot do in the existing system.
		- My role was to test the Angular UI, Spring API, and back-end system such as making sure data is being saved in the mainframe and SQL database systems. I was familiar with JS, TS, Spring going in, but gave me bit more exposure to how these tools are being used in production.
			- But, the project did require me to have an understanding of mainframe, SQL, and business requirements.
	- Visibility: US, Canada, Korea, other countries.
	- techs: Angular, Spring Server, Oracle SQL DB, Mainframe, PCF, AZURE DevOps for (TFS) to manage project

- global warranty management pre-validation project
	- purpose:
		- Implementing a new feature to an existing application
		- Essentially, business team required a feature that wants all __warranty transactions__ that are submitted at GM dealership for a particular service such as fixing brakes or engines to go though a validation before the transaction is ACC/PAID.
		- For example, one of the validations is that when a customer comes in to get their brakes fixed for their GM vehicle under Warranty and a claim is submitted. The app will verify that the technician that performed the services had a score for brakes that is above a threshold. If the technician score is not above the threshold, the claim/transaction will be REJECTED or HELP ROUTED to service desk for further processing before the claim can be ACC/PAID. Other validations: technician hours, Odometer value, and others. 
			- One of the benefits of this feature, is to make sure those technicians with highest score, which is determined by experience and training score, will reduce repeat repairs and reduce __Warranty__ costs for GM.
	- Techs:
		- Spring server, HTML and JavaScript, SQL DB, API testing via Insomnia alternative to Postman
	- Visibility: mainly Canada and US dealerships, but it impact countries in other continents such as China and Uzbekistan

	- Parts Workbench Re-write:
		- Purpose:
			- Worked on an application that is responsible for processing orders and shipping vehicle parts that is used in Canada and US dealerships.
			- Re-writing the back-end and front-end application and migrating the database from Oracle to OS PostgreSQL., and Reactjs
			- Essentially, technologies from 10 - 12 years ago, time and cost consuming and not UI friendly to the end-user.
				- For example, rather than navigating to two to three web pages to find the data user is looking for, it can be displayed in one page.
	- Techs: Reactjs, Spring Server, PostgreSQL (GM wants to adopt more OS software), Insomnia to test API via JSON and XML

# Team Related STAR / Qs

- __Tell me about a time where you were right about something but others disagree with you and how did you handle it (project), Describe a time you had to make a decision in a group project that the other group members did not like, but you had a genuine reason to make the decision, When was a time when you had a different opinion from another team member and how did you resolve this disagreement?__
	- In my previous internship I was working with a group to conduct an experiment and prepare a presentation of our results. As group we came up with an idea and a plan to implement our idea. 
	- A problem arose, where two of the team members wanted to hold daily meetings to discuss progress of project. I disagreed with this approach because we can easily communicate through messaging and google docs to document our progress.
	- Instead of starting an argument about the meetings, I gathered everyone together in the laboratory to communicate to them my  reasoning. 
		- I argued that as long as everyone knew their tasks, we did not need to divert time for meetings that did not move the project forward. Moreover, these meetings would use up valuable time that we could use to complete the project. 
		- I then, listened without judgment to their side of the argument. I remained patient and avoided interruption even though I disagreed with their reasoning.
	- Eventually, I decided to come to a general agreement and meet them halfway. The decision was to hold a daily meeting that would last no more than ten minutes where everyone provide a short update on their progress of their tasks.
	- In the end, we were able to complete the project on time and present our work.
	- I learned that when working in a team, there will always be difference in opinion or disagreements on how tasks are completed. As result, it is always important to demonstrate empathy, listen, and understand other person's perspective and meet them half-way. 

- __What would you do when a teammate isn't pulling their weight?, A time when you worked with a difficult person. Are you a team player in what way?, Tell me about a time where teamwork was essential?, Describe a time when you had to work with someone whose personality or work style was very different from yours?__
	- In one of my projects at General Motors, my teammate and I were tasked to write code to automate a front-end application testing and had to be completed in one week, which happened to be during our last week of the Sprint Cycle. 
	- However, my teammate did not start on writing the test case steps based on the Business Requirements. This hindered my ability to complete my task, which was dependent on the test case steps to be written out.
	- My task was to automate the written test case that my teammate would write via Java 
	- I reached out to my teammate in private call away from everyone else to understand why they were not able to complete their tasks. I listened to their response without judgment and showed empathy.
	- They explained to me that "they did not have much bandwidth to work on the assigned tasks this week, and in addition it was taking them more time than they anticipated to learn the particular feature of the application
	- So, we, then worked together to come up with a plan to complete the tasks. Knowing that they were inundated with work for another project and since we had a tight deadline, 
	- I offered to complete several test cases for them and demonstrated a quick demo of how the functionality of the particular page they were testing.
	- In the end, I was able to help my teammate complete their tasks, which allowed me to complete my automation scripts, which allowed the team to complete successfully on time, and sign off the app to UAT/Business.
	- I learned that when your teammate isn't pulling their weight, it important to communicate the issue to them in private and show empathy and listen to their response.
	- Doing that allowed us to resolve any blockers and issues in order to complete the assigned tasks on time.

- __Tell us of a time where you didn't agree with an idea on team project, Tell me about a situation where you didn't necessarily get along with teammates throughout a project. How did you manage this? When was a time you had to do something unpopular when working in a group setting? Unpopular decision?__	

	- During undergrad, I was assigned to work on a group project for a Java course. 
	- Everyone was assigned a specific task. My group decided to work independently from each other and collect all the work before the deadline and combine it into a final project report.
	- Every other day, we informed each other of the status on the project and everyone said they were on track to complete their tasks.
	- When the day came to put together our combined efforts into the final report, a week before the final deadline, we found out that one team member did not even finish 50% of what he was supposed to deliver. 
	- During our meeting, there was a lot of anger towards this particular team member because he failed to deliver on his task and this would mean the group would fail.  People were shouting at each other, which made the matter even worse.
	- To ease the tensions, I decided to take action. I attempted to calm everyone down and asked the teammate directly what went wrong and the reasons for not delivering on their part. 
	- I showed empathy and listened to our teammate without judgment. He told us that there some personal issues that he was dealing with at home and made it challenging for him to keep up with his course work. He apologized to the group for not delivering on time aaaaaaand I saw that he was very upset with himself. 
	- I suggest to the team, we should create a plan to help our teammate complete his task. The team members were still somewhat upset and some refused and some had other plans. 
	- Even though my idea was not popular and some of my teammates disagreed, I personally reached out to our teammate anyway and to communicate to him to get together and figured out a plan for him to complete his task.
	- I made sure that I was not going to do the work for them, but provided them enough support to make sure that everything they worked on would fit into the report perfectly.
	- In the end, not only did we complete and submit our project on time, we got an A on the project.
	- I learned that when working in groups, there will be times when we must make unpopular decision, or have disagreements with teammates. So, it is important to stay calm, listen, show empathy toward the teammates, and ultimately act objectively to complete the task at hand.

	- =================================
	- We both calmly presented the pros and cons of each approach. I reminded myself no matter the solution, it's important to not get emotional and keep professional.
	- After hearing each other well, and targeting the discussion only towards the subject of matter rather than any other person, we came to compromise.
	- If the matter was complicated and we cannot reach a solution, then we would both list the pros and cons of our approach and - .

- __Tell me about a time you did the right things but your peers thought otherwise__
	- While working on a project at General Motors, my teammates and I were tasked to test a particular feature that was added to an application.
	- My task included executing several test case scenarios to make sure data entered through the UI is being saved in the database and success and error messages are behaving as expected on a specific page.
	- However, I noticed my teammate test cases did not cover all of the edge case scenarios. Ex: entering non-alpha-numeric chars >= 100 chars. 
	- When I respectfully let me teammate to know, because just to make he did forget to test those scenarios. However, he informed he did not test those scenarios I had mentioned because it was not written in the business requirements.
	- So, I went ahead and not only did I test my page, I went ahead and tested those specific scenarios/edge cases on the page my teammate was assigned.
	- In the end, I was indeed able to find one bug and log a defect. Which prevent the bug from leaking into business/UAT deployment.
	- I learned that sometimes it's ok to go above and beyond and do the right thing even if it's challenging and may receive push back or if my peers think otherwise so in order to ship robust/bug-free applications to end-users or business team.

# Personal Based | Projects Related STAR / Qs
- __When have you completed a difficult task or project?, When have you learned a new skill or qualification?, When was a time you learned something new and what did you learn from it?, When was a time you worked really hard on a project and what was the result? A project you worked on and your proud of? and Why? , Changes you would make to it?__
	- A project that I really worked hard on was developing a book tracker app that allows users to track their favorite books, books they want to read, and books they have read using a microservices architecture.
	- This was a difficult task because at that time I was only familiar with developing  full-stack monolithic applications. Because of this, I had to learn new concepts about microservices and the technology tools needed to implement one.
	- I begin by using the SDLC process to plan, define, design, build, test, and deploy within a two week deadline.
	- To achieve this goal:
		- Then, I planned & design a high level diagram of how each component of the application fit together. For example, having  a book and user service with their own databases. 
		- Then, integrated the client side using Angular.
	- In the end, I was able to successfully complete this difficult project and deploy an Docker image of a  working microservices application to Docker Hub within the two week deadline I had set for myself.
	- I learned that persisting through challenges by breaking down a large problem into small tasks and prioritizing the tasks based on logical order allowed me to stay on track, avoid procrastination and complete the project on time.

- __Tell me about a time you were in a difficult situation. How you faced adversity and how you dealt with it? A challenge faced?, Describe a challenge you faced and how you overcame it, Describe a project you had difficulty doing? How did you solve it?__
	- In my current role, I had difficulty completing a task for a project I recently on-boarded on.
	- One of the biggest challenges were keeping up with the volume of work compared to what I was used to in college.
	- When I noticed myself feeling overwhelmed, I made a decision to work on my organization and time management skills. In addition, to increase my knowledge of the application we're working on.
	- I created a plan to break down each task I was assigned into smaller tasks and included time estimation for each task. 
	- I then, worked with my team leader to redistribute work that I will not be able to complete before the deadline of our current Sprint. I then went ahead and began to complete the most urgent and time-sensitive tasks first.
	- I also reached out to my teammates to understand and take note on particular components of the application that I was not familiar with.
	- I learned that difficult situations or a challenges at work are inevitable and a natural occurrence. When resolving a personal challenge at work, it's important to keep an objective eye on the problem and to step back and attempt or to action to find a solution to the problem. Also, to take advantage of the resources around me by communicating the issue to my team leader in order to complete the tasks before the deadline.
	- .
	- .
	- Conflict with a teammate:
	- I learned that difficult situations or a challenges at work are inevitable and a natural occurrence. When resolving a challenge at work, it's important to keep an objective eye on the problem and detach any feelings about the person or situation. Show empathy, listen without interrupting. And come to a consensus by considering both perspectives while keeping focus on the future.

- __Give an example of a goal you reached and tell how you achieved it.__
	- When I was interning at University of Wisconsin-Madison as Developer. I had set for myself a goal. 
	- My objectives for the internship was to develop proficiency in JavaScript and CSS. 
	- In order to achieve this goal, I designed a plan from the beginning of my internship on how I needed to complete my project of creating a data driven visualization model.
		- 1. For example, I sketched a model of the final product to understand the big picture.
		- 2. I worked backwards from the end product, and created a to-do list of what I need to do to achieve that outcome. I prioritized tasks based on the logical order of completing the pieces. "What should I do first, second ...". For example, understanding d3js code before implementing the model.
		- 3. Then, I created a timeline for completing each task. Having a deadline helped me become more focused for each task.
			- For example, for the first week it was important to become familiar with the basics of CSS and JavaScript by using online resources.
			- Read and understand the research articles about the algorithm.
			- Then, I research example D3js models to get an idea of what to build for the final product
		- 3. In addition, I made sure, I met with my mentor every day to discuss my progress to stay on track and most importantly make appropriate adjustments to the plan.
	- In the end, I was able to have intermediate understanding of JavaScript and CSS and complete my project on time and successfully present my results.
	- I learned breaking large tasks down into smaller manageable pieces and regularly meeting with my mentor allowed me to avoid stress and procrastination and complete my project on time.

- __Can you tell me about a mistake you made at work and how you handled it?, Tell me about a time you failed and the lesson you learned from it, Tell me about a time in which you could have done things differently.__ 
	 - I made the mistake..., I failed to..., What I could have done differently is... ask for help.
	 - At my previous internship, I had to implement a feature in a project and this was a visualization model on web page was not correctly rendering on the browser and moreover I had to present the project within a couple of days.
	 - The mistake i made was that rather than asking my mentor for assistance out of fear of looking incompetent, I spent 2 whole day trying to debug the problem by-myself without any progress. Then, I was worried that I would not be able to complete the presentation in time.
		 - However, in my next meeting I was able to bring up the problem.
		 - I admitted my mistake to my mentor and took full responsibility and that I should have sought help earlier. 
		 - Luckily, I managed to catch the mistake before the presentation was due to take place and I asked my mentor for help to complete it in time. 
	- Now, I make sure when I'm stuck to work on the task for 20 to 30min by myself and ask early enough to allow people plenty of time to provide assistance.

- __Tell me about a time you went above and beyond to complete a task?, What career accomplishments makes you most proud?__
	- In my current role, there was a situation were I had to validate data was correctly rendered in a particular page. 
	- However, there was an issue, the business requirement did not specify the format or layout of the web page. 
	- So, I had reached out to the dev responsible for that page, but they too did not have any knowledge if the specific layout page. They implemented it on an assumption.
	- I could not reach out to my team leader about the situation because they were Out of Office.
	- So, to resolve the issue, rather than wait 2 days until my team leader returned to office, I went above and beyond and created a mapping document to map the API data that was being pull with what should be rendered on the new web page being implemented and included screenshots of how the layout should look from my knowledge and assumptions.
	- I then, sent out an email to the business team leader and copied the dev lead, my PM, and my team leader.
	- A few hours later, I received a response to the email saying the mapping document that I created was indeed correct and they were impressed with the mapping document I had created so they asked me to attach it to the Business Requirements for documentation and future reference.
	- In the end, I was able to successfully validate the data and found several bugs that could have leaked to UAT/deployment 
	- And I received recognition and praise from my PM and team leader for demonstrating what General Motors calls it's on me behavior.
	- I learned that it's important to go above and beyond when the opportunities presents itself because doing so will not only save the team time and resources costs, but also to ultimately allow the team to deliver a robust product to business.

- __Tell me about a time you had to manage a particularly heavy workload. How did you handle it?, Name a time you had to do something you didn't know how to do? How did you approach it? If you had a lot of things to do and not enough time to do them, what would you do?__
	- In my current job, there was a moment, when I was allocated to work on three different projects at the same time, which was really challenging because one of my projects had a heavy workload than the other two projects.
	- To make matters worse, there were some tasks, that I did not know how to do (what data to input for some of the fields to thoroughly test the test case scenario, it's complex system; with little resources)
	- My job was to some how complete all my tasks that I was assigned for all 3 projects (writing test script and manual testing) within the current Sprint (1 Week) (one had a length of 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 3 weeks). 
	- After estimating the time for each task, It occurred to me that I will not be able to complete the tasks on time.
		- So, I took an action...in order to make sure that I was able to complete all the tasks before the end of the Sprint or deadline:
			- I immediately reached out to my team leaders for each project to communicate to them and lay out a workable plan of action to complete the tasks on time
				- I asked a series of questions that from the Business Requirements and had my team lead answer them to gain more knowledge of the application.
				- Then, I created a to-do list to complete the most urgent and important tasks first 
				- I decided to complete the tasks in a limited time that I set for myself and to do great work, but making sure not to waste time on perfectionism.
				- For some of the tasks,  I communicated to my team lead to re-distribute the low priority workload so that I can easily prioritize the important ones on my plate in order to meet the deadline.
				- Since, I tend to believe I have a strong work ethic, for some of the tasks, I had to work overtime for some days of the week.
		- In the end, while it was challenging and involved long hours, it payed off, I was able to complete my tasks before the deadline and have my team successfully handover the app to business/UAT. 
		- I learned that everyone can face a heavy workload at some point and it is important to take a step back and observe the situation at hand to gain clarity and objectivity and communicate with my team leaders to in order to create plan to complete the work on time.

# Strengths & Weaknesses Qs

- __What are your greatest weaknesses? (Show ow your improving your shortcomings)__
	- Sometimes my weakness is prioritization. 
		- When I am already working on a project and I have a new exiting project that've been tasked to work on.
		- I stop working on the project that I was working on to start this new project. Sometimes, I have to switch back and forth between projects and this really hinders my progress and my ability to deliver my best work. 
		- NOW, for example, to improve this weakness, when I'm handed a new task, I first create a to-do list of tasks. I then, write down a number next to each task to mark which tasks get done first: I prioritize the most urgent, time-sensitive, most impactful tasks first. And I go down the list.
	- My other weakness is my writing skills. 
		- Sometimes my sentences are too wordy and include unnecessary words, this might negatively impact business and my team members. For example, going back and forth on email can be a waste of time.
		- NOW, to improve my writing skills, On my free time, I often write about the new technologies that I learn in my spare time. By summarizing concepts and making connections.
		- This has helped better communicate my knowledge in a more concise, succinct way to others.
		- Also, Doing small things such as proof-reading my emails to see if I can communicate my message in more direct way has been a great way to improve this weakness.
	- "I can be too critical of myself"
		- A pattern I've noticed throughout my career is that I often feel I could have done more, even if objectively, I've done well.
		- Earlier in my career, this led to burnout and negative self-talk.
		- NOW, one solution I've implemented over the last 3 years is to actively pause and celebrate my achievements. 
		- Not only has this helped my own self-esteem, but it has also helped me genuinely appreciate and recognize my team and other support systems.

- __What are your greatest strengths?__
	- Technical Ability
		- I'm always interested in learning new tools and technologies that makes more productive as result it improves my technical abilities. 
		- When I see a new tool or technology, for example, JWTs, I try to google and read documentations and blog posts to understand the technology and what specific problem it's trying to solve. And, I tinker around with the technology. Doing so, it allows me to get a grasp about the technology.
		- I am always seeking ways to improve and develop my skills to better perform at work.
	- Collaboration skills
		- I'm very collaborative. Even though I can work both independently and in a group. Enjoy exchanging ideas with the team when solving major problem or issues. 
		- For example, in my current role, my team had major road blocks in one of our sprints. We did not have enough resources and there was a knowledge gap among the team about the inter-working of the application.
		- However, working as team made a lot easier to get the job done. Ultimately, my team was recognized by my organization at the General Motors quarterly meetings for demonstrating one team, think customer, and it's on me behaviors.
	- Time Management	
		- Currently, I'm working on 3 different projects and planning and prioritizing my tasks for each projects helps me stay organized and manage my time wisely.
		- I think the most valuable skill I have is time-management. I am diligent in using a calendar to plan long-term tasks and a todo-list to complete day to day tasks.
		- In addition, I use time-blocking productivity method along with Pomodoro technique to set blocks of time to complete my assignments and take small breaks in between. Planing helps me stay organized and manage my time wisely.

	- Enjoy discussing with team when an issue arises to come up with a possible solution.
	- I enjoy writing code.
	- I enjoy finding bugs, even going above and beyond to test additional scenarios, in order to reduce bug leakage to UAT.
	- I enjoy helping build a robust software that benefits business and organization.
	- The only thing I dislike, is the lack of documentation within the organization. 
	- The lack of documentation that is provided to our team when we go test, I leaves the team to heavily depend on the developers for clarification, and going back forth with the dev reduces valuable working time that we can otherwise use to complete our tasks.
		- So, to solve this problem, for future team member, we have created a Microsoft One Note, that provides detailed explanation of different parts of the application that we have used to test in layman terms.

- [__What are you short and long-term career goals?, How do you want to improve yourself in the next year?, What are your career goals? Where do you want to be in five years? 10 years?__]
	- I would love to become an expert in a particular domain
		- such as Java-based frameworks or tools to to become the go-to person and to provide knowledge on interesting projects that can have major impact on business that eventually contribute to the growth of the company.
	- Also, if the opportunity presents itself for me to progress within the organization that would be amazing.
	- And since I am really passionate about the work I do as a developer I would love the opportunity to mentor other employees later down the line.
	- All in all, I plan to stay with the company long-term if I am given the opportunity to work at  this company.

- __What are your relationships like with coworkers? Managers? How woud your co-workers describe you?__ 
	- easy going
	- strong work ethic
	- smart
	- can work both independently and as a team. I complete all my tasks that are assigned to me.

# Resume

__Know what to say for everything on the resume including your current project your working on GWM Pre-val and SUI and Re-write of legacy application. Keep your answers short and let the interviewer ask the questions.__

- Automation Tools
	- Intellij
	- In house modified version of Selenium Automation Framework in Java,
		- Part of a team that updated existing scripts written in JavaScript and Python Scripts for performance of an application.

	- Skills:
		- Debugging
			- Use Intellij to do UI to test of an Angular and Reactjs Web App to validate all the associated data of a part that is searched is pull and viewed in the UI. 
				- But results were not as expected. So, I had to run the debugger and found out an incorrect HTML tag value was being used to validate data. 
				- So, I fixed the bug by providing the correct tag id and ran the code again and test passed.
				- API testing via Insomnia
				- Database making sure specific tables exist
		- Finding Bugs
			- Single User Interface
				- data mismatch between database and UI
					- A particular page was not displaying data in mainframe for a particular part
			- GWM Pre-validation
				- For a specific scenario, when the claim is suppose to get accepted it rejects. 
					- For example, when the technician hours/TPS exceed the threshold, claim is accepted when it should reject
		- Writing Clean Code
			- Re-factoring code by creating a method that other methods can call to reduce code redundancy. Makes it easier to debug and for code readability.
			- Ex: Rather than having each method call the database with the same code. Simply create a separate method that does the database call and get a query as its parameter

# Personal Projects
 - What issue did you face and how you resolved it?  (2 issues and 2 resolution)
	- Pick a specific issue, you've came across
	- documentation stackoverflow. youtube resuorcse. I learned to persist and not give up.
	- Somtimes taking a break (5min walk) to clear head and come back to the problem with a different approach or take. Issue are enviteably, just systemically trying to resolve the issue.

- Most challenging part?
 - What did you learn?
 - Spring Security

 - JSON Web Token

 - Microservices in Spring
	 - Eureka
	 - Zuul

- __News Feed App__
	- Django (What is it??) 
		- an open-source web framework that follows model-template-views architecture pattern (similar to MVC)
		- It encourages rapid development and clean design
		- It comes with full-featured and secure authentication system
		- handles accounts, groups, permissions, and cookie-based sessions right out of the box.
	- A full-stack app that allows users to search & retrieve live articles based on categories of interest using Django Python Framework, which is known for allowing developers to build small apps fast.
	- Used SQL database PostgreSQL, which is the recommended database for Django.
	- In addition, incorporated CI/CD pipeline created using a Travis-CI yaml file that is automatically triggered when a commit is pushed to GitHub. The script includes automatic deployment of the Docker image that is created to Docker Hub
	- Improvements
		- Expand search categories, maybe rather than categories such as Sports, Entertainment, filter Articles by keywords or phrases, such as a Sports athlete, Shaq.
		- Auto-complete search in the search box
		- Maybe incorporate book and movie APIs
		- Deploy (Maybe) to service (app) the docker image

- __Movie & TV Shows Search App__
	- Improvements:
	- Vue.js
		- Improvments:
			- Add Authentication connected with a database such as mongodb to have users sign in and register for an account
			- save their favorite links get a feed of favorite topics, words

- __Book Microservices__
	- REST API that lets you CRUD books. Create Read Update Delete
	- ![[Pasted image 20210728161117.png]]

## Angular vs Vuejs vs Reactjs vs Docker
- What is Kubernetes? 
	- Greek for helmsman--someone who steers the ship, like a container ship or pilot or
	- Container orchestration tool
	- It automates the process of scaling, managing, updating, and removing containers.
	- Can run it on major cloud hosting platforms such as Azure, AWS, GCP
- What is Docker?
	- an open source platform that allows developers to package apps into containers and run and deploy them to prod.
	- Most importantly the containers are isolated from one another. So, you can run a docker containers in a developer's laptop, or in the cloud.
	- Image and Container. Image is similar to a class in java, it's the blue print in which the Container is built or in Java an object is an instance of a class with it's own state and behavior.
Angular 
- typescript
- splits HTML, TypeScript logic apart
- a lot of tools out of the box
	- routing
	- form validation and handling
	- Http client
Reactjs
- combines HTML, JS called JSX
Vuejs
- splits HTML, JS logic apart
- easy to learn

All 3
- help develop complex, reactive, modern UI fro the web and mobile
- Virtual DOM manipulation
- State management
- Reusable components 
- Anatomy of a Component

## Spring Cloud
- What is Spring Boot?
	- 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO3W-lYnw-o
- The Bigineer's Guide to Spring Cloud - Ryan Baxter
Spring Cloud Components / Ecosystems
- Configuration
- Service Discovery
	- We need to have the services talk to each other
	- Eureka, Zookeeper, Consul
- Circuit Breakers
	- protect app and user from failure or slow. Insolate services from each other. If one goes down, only that goes down.
	- Request to DB, other internal microservice, 
	- If request is taking a long time or error response, then we send a useful message to the client by tripping the breaker
- Routing and Messaging
	- Spring Cloud supports communication between microservices via HTTP request or via messaging
	- Routing and Load Balancing
		- Netflix Ribbon and Open Feign
	- Messaging
		- RabbitMQ or Kafka
- API Gateway
	- route requests from clients to back-end microservices
	- Netflix Zuul
		- leverages service discovery and load balancer
		- Spring Cloud Gateway (new reactive project)
- Tracing
	- Important feature that tracks requests across services
	- Great for debugging
	- a centralized location to view logs and latency information 
	- Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin
- CI Pipelines and Testing
	- Automatic build and deployment
- RestTemplate
	- To consume RESTful services use RestTemplate class that allows you to send HTTP requests to a RESTful server and fetch data in JSON or XML

Ribbon (@LoadBalanced)
- uses round-robin algorithm, if you have multiple instances of a service available, it picks one for you.
	```java
		@Autowired
		@LoadBalanced     // Make sure to inject the load-balanced template
		protected RestTemplate restTemplate;
	```

## Coding best practices to follow
- Follow the company's study guide
	- such as indentation, place of braces and spaces, and naming conventions
	- each language should have one
- Don't reinvent the wheel
- make sure your code is readable
	- ask yourself questions. is this feature really necessary? who benefits from this? has anyone else in the organization or team or open source tool already coded a similar solution
- In addition to efficient and optimized code, make sure to write readable code and understandable code. Code that can be understood can be integrated more easily, saving time costs.
- Comment and document
	- Focus more on why the function or method is doing what its doing more than the how.
- DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
	- this  a great principle that will save you time and energy. 
	- When you see repetitive code abstract it into a method or a class
- KISS - Keep It Simple 
	- Not only should you strive to make your code readable, but also simple
	- complex code means likelihood for more bugs and mistakes.
- Test your code
- Descriptive variable names
	- getLowestPrice or setLowestPrice for method names rather than LowestPrice
	- Methods should start with a verb such as get, set, is
- Collaborate
	- Share your ideas with your teammates whether in standup or somewhere else
		- it leads to better ideas and better way of approaching a problem than you had not though of
- Have Fun
	- At the end of the day, it's important to remember, we're coding because we enjoy it on some level. And work on projects that interest you.
	- Work together as a team because everyone benefits that way
