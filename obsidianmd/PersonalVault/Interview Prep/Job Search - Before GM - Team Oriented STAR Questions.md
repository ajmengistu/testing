## Team related STAR Q&A 
- ```Tell me about a time where you were right about something but others disagree with you and how did you handle it? project., Describe a time you had to make a decision in a group project that the other group members did not like, but you had a genuine reason to make the decision, When was a time when you had a different opinion from another team member and how did you resolve this conflict?```
	- In my previous internship, research assistant, I was working with a group to conduct an experiment and prepare a presentation of our results. As group we came up with an idea and a plan to implement our idea. 
	- My job was to work with one other group member to run the experiment and hand over the experimental results to the other group members
	- A problem arose, where two of the team members wanted to hold daily meetings to discuss progress of project. I disagreed with this approach because we can easily communicate through messaging and google docs to document our progress.
	- Instead of starting an argument about the meetings, I was understanding and took initiative to resolve the issue, I gathered everyone together in the laboratory to communicate to them my  reasoning. 
		- I argued that as long as everyone knew their tasks, we did not need to divert time for meetings that did not move the project forward. Moreover, these meetings would use up valuable time that we could to complete the project. 
		- I then, listened without judgment to their side of the argument. I remained patient and avoided interruption even though I disagreed with their reasoning.
	- Eventually, I decided to come to a general agreement and meet my teammates halfway. The decision was to hold a daily meeting that would last no more than ten minutes where everyone provide a short update on their progress of their tasks.
	- In the end, we were able to complete the project on time and present our work.
	- I learned that when working in teammates, people have difference of opinions, and it's important to come together and find a reasonable decision with the long term goal in mind.

- `What would you do when a teammate isn't pulling their weight?, A time when you worked with a difficult person.  Are you a team player in what way?, Tell me about a time where teamwork was essential?,`
	- A class member and I had to work together to complete full-stack application (Survey System). However, my team member members was behind in the project, not pulling his weight, which hindered my progress, because my implementation was dependent on his server API.
	- My job was to complete the front-end of the project using a Reactjs framework,
	- I first tried to contact him through messaging and I did not receive any response.
	- I sat down with him in private away from everyone else to understand why he was unable to finish his section of the project in time. I showed empathy by understanding and putting myself in his shoes and listened to his problem.
	- He explained to me that he had been having computer issue, his computer was giving trouble because of the `npm` project dependencies was not working correctly and was unable to complete his the API implementation.
	- We got together, to come up with possible solutions, like I suggested borrowing a laptop from the University library, but I eventually volunteered let him use my laptop to complete his part of the project.  
	- At the end, we were all able to complete our work in time, and the project was completed successfully.
	- I learned taking the time to communicate the issue and showing empathy and listening to understand his situation, and figuring out a a common solution was critical for the project completion.

- Do you do better as a team member or individually?
	- Work well both as a team and individually.
	- I understand there are benefits to work both as a team and individually
	- team
		- working with research assistant at laboratory, 
		- collaboration, see an idea or concept from another person's point view
		- brainstorming ideas, drives innovation, finding gaps in my knowledge
		- working with a team toward a common goal
	- Individual 
		- studying a new concept
		- programming my project, debugging code errors

- Tell us of a time were you didn't agree with an idea on team project, Tell me about a situation where you didn't necessarily get along with teammates throughout a project. How did you manage this?  
	- He was trying to complete the project

- Tell me about a time you did the right things but your peers thought otherwise
	- During my undergraduate course in Data Science course, I was working with a group to complete a python project, however a group member was doing everyone's tasks that we were all assigned to complete. I did not think that was the right thing to do, we were all assigned to contribute equally to the project. So, privately approached my teammate in person and took him to the side, instead of pointing fingers, I told t
	- It turned out, he was very familiar with the concepts that were being applied and was excited to be working on the project. I explained to that the other group members and I are losing out on a learning opportunity. He though we did not mind, and I thought that was the right thing to do.
	- We  decided, we would contribute equally and any concept that were clear, we would come to him for clarification.
	- In the end, we were are able to successfully complete the project on time. I learned that its important to do the right things, even if it's challenging and may receive push back or if my peers think otherwise for the greater good.
