Hi I graduated in Summer 2019 (about 2 years ago)
I'll talking points talking


Hello, my name is 
about re-enrollement into the CS program. I graduated in 2019 with a Bio degree. Before, I graduated with Bio degree, I was also majoring in CS prior to graduation. What does that process look like? I'm guess I would have to apply to be a student a umd student again. If I went ahead and became student, will the CS department allow me to finish my degree (complete the remaining courses). 

- A general question
- Specific question to CS department, can I easily, do I need re-apply 
- How long it will take me to complete my degree after enrollment; will all the credits I've taken count toward my degree.

- Will be able to automatically be enrolled into the CS major or do I need to apply into

Hello HR,

My name is AJ, I started as a New College Hire (NCH) in November 2020. I'm currently level 5A. My question is if I wanted to transition to a new role as a Software Developer from Software Test Engineer after 12 months (December 2021) of employment as a NCH, would that be possible? If not 12 months, what does the timeline look like for NCH's that wish to transition to a new role internally within GM?

Thanks,
AJ

Things I like
- I have a job
- Teammates

Things I hate
- I may be asked to present in front of the team (20)
- It's a QA role not a Dev; Dev fits my personality more
- I do not enjoy testing more than dev, but better than no job
