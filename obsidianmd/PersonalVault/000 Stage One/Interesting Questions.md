	- Actually we do have our own simulations when we are having a night dream. Think about it. When you are in your night dream you are kind of in another reality. At that time it feels as if that reality is the only one possible. You do not have a clue that at that time actually you are lying in bed dreaming and the reality you are feeling is not true. In this dreaming reality you are feeling anger, passion, happiness, pain, fear and love just as well as in your real reality. And you cannot suspect that this reality is not actually real. It is true, is not it? But in the morning you wake up and analyze that that dream makes no sense at all. You cannot fly, you are not a super hero, and your dream violates the basic laws of physics. And the most important thing is that every other night you have a different dream and do not remember anything about the dream the night before. And there is an interesting question. What if in your current dream you remember your previous dreams from all nights before. In this way your dream would be connected with the previous ones. It would be like the continuation of the story you had at previous nights. When you are 30 years old you would have a very long dreaming story. It feels like you are living one more life in a different reality. Since you remember your dreams when you wake up in the morning than you remember both of your lives when you are awake. And what if you also remember your real life when you are dreaming? It this case you would live in two realities, had friends and social life in both of them, would remember both of them at the same time and eventually your brain would not be able to identify which reality is real and which is not.

wrong yeah but you don't have to have
79:16
kids
79:16
like this this idea that the path that
79:18
everybody takes is the path you have to
79:20
have there's there's something about it
79:21
that used to infuriate me when i
79:23
when i was younger where uh people would
79:25
tell people with children would tell you
79:26
you have to have a child
79:28
yeah and i believe that feels like a
79:29
prisoner telling me that i need to
79:30
commit a crime that's right
79:32
like come come with us it's you don't
79:34
have to
79:35
no you don't have to i don't look i
79:36
don't i don't have a
79:38
like a steadfast rule for anything
79:42
involving human beings in their path in
79:44
life as long as they're doing no harm
79:46
yeah i think as soon as someone does i
79:48
always feel like they're trying to
79:49
justify their
79:50
own path but try like how many people
79:52
who do certain things want you to do
79:54
those thing
