## Intro
- Forgive me for having invited you here on the basis of having some African ancestry.
- Bret evolutionary biologist, recent 1000s of years,
	 - Its fair to assume everybody in the panel can trace their ancestry to Africa in the last 1000 years
		 - Except, Bret, who traces his ancestry in the last 1000 years to Europe
 - "All of of us, have entirely African ancestry"
 - We are in a renewed racial conflict that is badly cast, and a distraction to a much deeper issue that is:
	 - long-standing, and extensive political corruption that has frozen citizens out of the well being that is produced by their labor in our markets.
	 - We are in fact being misled into fighting each other when there is a much more obvious enemy.

	- Batting cleanup 
		- to finish a job that other have started. The implication is that someone who is batting cleanup is the most competent.
