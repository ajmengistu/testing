## strengths/weakness
- What are some of your strengths? 
	- For example, I when I learned that Vue.js was an alternative JS framework to React and Angular, I went online and read through the documentation and small project, and talks on YouTube. Then, I came up with a simple project to apply what I learned.
	- At the end I learned that Vuejs is a lot more simpler than Vuejs and fairly easy to pick up.
	- I am always seeking ways to improve and develop my skills to better perform at work.
		- How you learned microservices. I have strong work ethic so, to complete what I started.
	- I enjoy working collaboratively.
		- I work well both independently and as a team. At the same time, I also enjoy supporting and helping develop my teammates.
		- For example, I working with my mentor who was a graduate student and a Professor to implement a working project within a tight deadline.
		- I think the most valuable skill I have is time-management. I am diligent in using a calendar to plan long-term tasks and a todo-list to complete day to day tasks. In addition, I use time-blocking productivity method along with pomodoro technique to set blocks of time to complete task and take breaks. Planing helps me stay organized and manage my time wisely.

my technical skills
- “I’m obsessed with the newest version of [insert name of new software]. I started pushing the boundaries of what it could do as soon as it was released. I’m excited about applying my passion and abilities to this position and pushing the envelope of this program for your company.”

organization skills:
- I rarely miss deadlines. I'm highly organized. During my undergraduate courses, I plan ahead using a planner and a calander to mark exam dates, and the task I need to complete and time I need to review to prepare for my exams. This has allowed me avoid missing assignments and projects.

collaboration skills
- “I’m very collaborative and have always preferred to work in groups. In the project teams I’ve directed, members work with a variety of people and are motivated by diverse creative tasks. Since I began managing my current team, I’ve increased productivity by 15 percent and retention by 25 percent over three years.”

What are some of your weaknesses? 
1.  Sometimes my weakness is prioritization. 
	- When I am already working on a project and I have a new project idea to implement.
	-  I stop working on the project that I was working to start this new project. Sometimes, I have to switch back and forth between project and this really hinders my progress and my ability to deliver my best work. 
	- So, to strengthen my prioritization skills, I often decided on the most urgent tasks first, before tackling other or new projects. This way I'm able to give my all on a single most important tasks, before moving to complete others.
2. My other weakness is my writing skills. Sometimes my sentences are too wordy and include unnecessary words, this might negatively impact team work. And so to improve my writing skills, I often publish blog posts online about new technologies that I learn in my spare time. And also write about some of the technologies that I integrate into my projects. This has helped better communicate my knowledge in a more concise, succinct way to others.
3. “I can be too critical of myself. A pattern I’ve noticed throughout my career is that I often feel I could have done more, even if objectively, I’ve done well. Earlier in my career, this led to burnout and negative self-talk. One solution I’ve implemented over the last three years is to actively pause and celebrate my achievements. Not only has this helped my own self-esteem, but it has also helped me genuinely appreciate and recognize my team and other support systems.”

## Short term and long term:
- Short-term and long-term goals? talk about job description and the company and how you are good fit?
	- I would love to become an expert in a particular domain, 
		- in particular programming language such as Java and use these tools to find efficient solutions to problems that can potentially contribute to the growth in all the areas GM provides services to the end consumer
	- Also, if the opportunity presents itself for me to progress within the organization that would be amazing.
	- And since I am really passionate about the work I do as a developer I would love the opportunity to mentor other employees later down the line.
	- All in all, I plan to stay with the company long-term if I am given the opportunity to work at General Motors.
